# Custom Spatial Binning and LSTM-Attention Model fo EQ Forecasting

This project performs earthquake catalog preprocessing and spatial binning (grid-based or quadtree) in preparation for a deep learning model using an LSTM with Attention Mechanism. The model forecasts seismic activity across spatial bins based on historical patterns.
